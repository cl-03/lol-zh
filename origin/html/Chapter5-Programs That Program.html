<p>One of the most common mischaracterisations of lisp is calling it a functional programming language. Lisp is not functional. In fact it can be argued that lisp is one of the least functional languages ever created. This misunderstanding has interesting roots and is a good example of how a small misnomer can have long-lasting influence and end up causing confusion long after the reasons behind the misnomer have passed into irrelevance. What is a functional language? The only definition that makes sense is</p><p><i>A functional language is a programming language made up of functions.</i></p><p>So what is a function? A function is a concept from <i>math</i> that has been with us for centuries:</p><p><i>A function is a static, well-defined mapping from input values to output values.</i></p><p>It seems like we use <b>defun</b> to define new functions in lisp. For example, the following seems to be a function that uses summation to map the set of all numbers to a new set, one that also includes all numbers:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">(defun adder (x)
  (+ x 1))</pre><p></p><p>Obviously we can apply this object to any number and get the mapped result from its return value, but is <b>adder</b> really a function? Well, confusingly, lisp tells us that it is<a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap5.html#" onclick="toggle_note(1); return false"><sup>1</sup></a><span id="note_1" style="display:none"> <sup><i>If you haven't already seen the C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> <b>describe</b> function before, try it right now. Describe a function, a special form, a macro, a variable, a symbol, and a closure.</i></sup> </span>:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (describe #'adder)

#&lt;Interpreted Function&gt; is a function.</pre><p></p><p>But calling this object a function is one of the deepest-rooted misnomers in lisp history. What <b>defun</b> and lambda forms actually create are <i>procedures</i> or, more accurately still, <i>funcallable instances</i><sup><small>[AMOP]</small></sup>. Why the distinction? Procedures don't necessarily have anything to do with mapping values, but instead are pieces of code, possibly with stored environment, that can be executed (funcalled). When lisp programmers write in a certain style called <i>functional style</i>, then the resulting procedures can be thought of and combined together pretending that they are math-style functional maps.</p><p>The reason why lisp is so often incorrectly described as a functional language has to do with history. Believe it or not but there was once a time when most languages didn't even support the concept of a procedure that modern programmers in any language take for granted. Very early languages didn't provide a suitable abstraction for locally naming arguments in a piece of re-usable code and programmers had to manually allocate registers and manipulate stacks to achieve this behaviour. Lisp, a language that had procedures all along, seemed way more functional than these languages.</p><p>Next, once procedural abstraction was given the attention it deserved and incorporated into almost all programming languages, people started to slowly run up against barriers due to the limited nature of the procedures they had implemented. Programmers started to realise that they would like to be able to return procedures from other procedures, embed them in new environments, aggregate them in data-structures, and, in general, treat them as any old regular value. A slogan sprang up to mobilise programmers for this next big abstraction push: a society without classes, <i>first-class procedures</i>. In comparison to languages that relegated the procedure to an inferior second class, lisp, a language that has had these first-class procedures all along, seemed way more functional.</p><p>Finally, many languages make a pointless distinction between expression and statement, usually to support some horrible Blub syntax like infix assignment. In lisp, everything returns something<a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap5.html#" onclick="toggle_note(2); return false"><sup>2</sup></a><span id="note_2" style="display:none"> <sup><i>Except <b>(values)</b> which returns nothing. But even this is coerced to <b>nil</b> and so can be used in expressions.</i></sup> </span> and there are no (syntactic) restrictions on what you can nest or combine. It is a simple question with an obvious answer: what is more important in a language, newbie-friendly syntax or real flexibility? Any language that uses infix syntax is reducing the possibilities of its abstractions in many ways. Luckily most modern languages have decided to trust their users enough to allow them to combine expressions mostly as they see fit. In comparison to languages that make these sorts of brain-dead syntax decisions, lisp seems way more functional.</p><p>After having become comfortable with this ubiquitous yet misguided terminology, programmers started to realise that the notion of function that had been used in the great functional vs non-functional programming language debate is not only confusing, but is actually fundamentally backwards. To correct this, programmers and academics alike went back to the drawing board, returning to the mathematical definition of a function: a map from input values to output values. If lisp is in any way a functional language, it is only as much so as modern languages such as Perl and Javascript.</p><p>Clearly lisp procedures are not functions. Lisp procedures can return non-static values, that is you can call them multiple times with the same arguments and receive different return values each time. As in our examples from previous chapters, lisp procedures can store state by closing over variables. Procedures like <b>rplaca</b> can change values in memory or elsewhere (such as registers). Lisp procedures like <b>terpri</b> and <b>format</b> create output (newlines in the case of <b>terpri</b>) directed to terminals or files<a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap5.html#" onclick="toggle_note(3); return false"><sup>3</sup></a><span id="note_3" style="display:none"> <sup><i><b>Terpri</b> and <b>rplaca</b>—both have reasonable claim to the distinction of worst-named C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> operator.</i></sup> </span>. Lisp procedures like <b>yes-or-no-p</b> can read input from a terminal and return values depending on what the user entered. Are these procedures static, well-defined mappings?</p><p>Because lisp procedures are not mathematical functions, lisp is not a functional language. In fact, a strong argument can be made that lisp is even less functional than most other languages. In most languages, expressions that look like procedure calls are enforced by the syntax of the language to be procedure calls. In lisp, we have macros. As we've seen, macros can invisibly change the meaning of certain forms from being function calls into arbitrary lisp expressions, a technique which is capable of violating referential transparency in many ways that simply aren't possible in other languages.</p><p>After considering that most languages are in fact not at all functional, some language designers decided to find out what programming in a really functional language would be like. As you would expect, programming functional languages is mostly annoying and impractical. Almost no real-world problems can be usefully expressed as static, well-defined mappings from input values to output values. That being said, functional programming is not without merit and many languages have been designed to take advantage of a functional style of programming. What that means is finding a convenient way of isolating the functional parts of a program from the (actually interesting) non-functional parts. Languages like Haskell and Ocaml use this isolation as a means of making aggressive optimisation assumptions.</p><p>But this is lisp. We're very non-functional and very proud of it. To the extent that this isolation of side-effects is useful, lisp programmers can and do implement it with macros. The real purpose behind functional programming is to separate the functional description of what should happen from the mechanics of how it actually does happen. Lisp is definitely not functional, but, because of macros, there is no better platform or material for implementing functional languages than lisp.</p><h3 id="sec_2">Top-Down Programming</h3>
<p><i>You cannot teach beginners top-down programming, because they don't know which end is up.

—C.A.R. Hoare</i></p><p>In <a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap3.html#sec_2">section 3.2, Domain Specific Languages</a> when we first looked at domain specific languages, we created a simple macro, <b>unit-of-time</b>. This macro lets us conveniently specify periods of time in various units with an intuitive, symbol-based syntax:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (unit-of-time 1 d)

86400</pre><p></p><p><b>Unit-of-time</b> is a handy domain specific language because the programmer isn't required to remember, for instance, how many seconds are in a day. <b>Unit-of-time</b> is implemented with a simple macro that uses a case statement as the heart of the underlying expansion.</p><p>An important principle of macro design is <i>top-down</i> programming. When designing a lisp macro, you want to start with the abstraction first. You want to write programs that use the macro long before you write the macro itself. Somewhat paradoxically, you need to know how to program in a language before you can write a concise definition/implementation for that language.</p><p>So the first step in serious macro construction is always to write <i>use cases</i> of the macro, even though there is no way you can test or use them. If the programs written in the new language are comprehensive enough, a good idea of what will be required to implement a compiler or interpreter for the language will follow.</p><p>Considering our <b>unit-of-time</b> macro, is there a way we can bump this up another level of specification and create a language for creating these sorts of unit convenience macros? Well, <b>unit-of-time</b> is a macro, so to do this we will need a macro defining macro...</p><p><i>Stop!</i> That end is up.</p><p>We are not starting by considering the implementation of a language, but rather asking ourselves what we would like to use this language for. The answer is that we would like a simple way to define these sorts of unit conversion helpers. In the following example use case, we would like to be able to take a type of unit, <b>time</b>, a base unit, seconds, represented here by <b>s</b>, and a collection of pairs of a unit and the conversion factor for this unit to the base unit:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">(defunits% time s
  m 60
  h 3600
  d 86400
 ms 1/1000
 us 1/1000000)</pre><p></p><p><b>Defunits%</b> could then expand into code that defines a macro like <b>unit-of-time</b> we wrote in <a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap3.html#sec_2">section 3.2, Domain Specific Languages</a>, allowing us to convert arbitrary time units to seconds. Could it get any better?</p><p>This is the point in the design brainstorming that innovation halts in most programming languages. We just created a way to map multiplier values for different units into code that allows us to convert units at our convenience. But a professional lisp programmer recognises that this mapping is a program itself and can be enhanced through the means we regularly enhance lisp programs.</p><p>When we are entering many different units it might be helpful to specify units in terms of other units. Let's mandate that the factor used to multiply the unit could also be a list with a value relative to another unit, like so:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">(defunits%% time s
  m 60
  h (60 m)
  d (24 h)
 ms (1/1000 s)
 us (1/1000 ms))</pre><p></p><p>This <i>chaining</i> of units just feels natural. Minutes are specified in terms of our base unit, seconds, hours in terms of minutes, and days in terms of hours. To implement this macro in an iterative fashion we first implement unchained behaviour with <b>defunits%</b> and next implement chaining with <b>defunits%%</b> before add appropriate error checking and settle on our final version, <b>defunits</b>.</p><p>Notice that this new language can provide more than just a convenient syntax for adding new types of units. This language also allows us to delay the impact of <i>rounding</i> in our calculations and also lets lisp use as much exact arithmetic as possible. For instance, the furlong is defined to be exactly 1/8th of a mile, so if we encoded it that way using chaining instead of, say, a metric approximation, we could end up with more accurate results or, perhaps more importantly, results that are as consistent as possible with other calculations using miles. Because we can just add the most precise conversion factor we find and don't have to bother doing any converting ourselves, this macro will let us build conversion routines at a level of expression not possible in other languages.</p><p>Using our automatic gensym behaviour described in <a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap3.html#sec_5">section 3.5, Unwanted Capture</a>, <b>defunits%</b> is fairly easy to write. Graham's <b>symb</b> function lets us generate the new name for the conversion macro. For example, if the symbol <b>time</b> is the type of unit provided then the new conversion macro will be <b>unit-of-time</b>. <b>Defunits%</b> was constructed by taking our original definition of <b>unit-of-time</b>, defined in <a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap3.html#sec_2">section 3.2, Domain Specific Languages</a>, surrounding it with a <b>defmacro!</b> and a backquote, and replacing the parts that need to be regenerated each time the macro is invoked.</p><p></p><fieldset><legend>DEFUNITS-1</legend><pre class="lol_code">(defmacro! defunits% (quantity base-unit &amp;rest units)
  `(defmacro ,(symb 'unit-of- quantity) (,g!val ,g!un)
     `(* ,,g!val
         ,(case ,g!un
           ((,base-unit) 1)
           ,@(mapcar (lambda (x)
                       `((,(car x)) ,(cadr x)))
                     (group units 2))))))</pre></fieldset><p></p><p><b>Defunits%</b> uses a <i>nested backquote</i>—a construct notoriously difficult to understand. Programming with backquotes is almost like having one more dimension of meaning in your code. In other languages, a given programming statement usually has very simple evaluation semantics. You know when every bit of code will run because every bit of code is forced to run at the same time: run-time. But in lisp by nesting backquotes we can scale up and down a <i>ladder of quotation</i>. Every backquote we write takes us one step up this ladder: our code is a list that we may or may not evaluate later. But inside the raw list, every comma encountered takes us back down the quotation ladder and actually executes the code from the appropriate step on the ladder<sup><small>[CLTL2-P967]</small></sup>.</p><p>So there is a simple algorithm for determining when any bit of code in a lisp form will be evaluated. Simply start from the root of the expression and after encountering a backquote, mark up one level of quotation. For every comma encountered, mark down one level of quotation. As Steele notes<sup><small>[CLTL2-P530]</small></sup>, following this level of quotation can be challenging. This difficulty, the need to track your current quotation depth, is what makes using backquote feel like another dimension has been added onto regular programming. In other languages you can walk north, south, east, and west, but lisp also gives you the option of going up.</p><p><b>Defunits%</b> is a good first step, but still doesn't implement chaining. Right now, the macro implementing this language is mostly a straightforward substitution. Implementing our chaining behaviour will require more sophisticated program logic. Simple substitution won't work because parts of the macro depend on other parts of the macro, so when we build our expansion we need to process the forms provided to the macro completely, not just thinking about it in terms of individual pieces we can splice in.</p><p></p><fieldset><legend>DEFUNITS-CHAINING-1</legend><pre class="lol_code">(defun defunits-chaining% (u units)

          chain)))))</pre></fieldset><p></p><p>Remembering that macros are really just functions, we create a utility function for use in the macro definition, <b>defunits-chaining%</b>. This utility function takes a unit, as specified by symbols like <b>S</b>, <b>M</b>, or <b>H</b>, and a list of unit specs. We let unit specs either have a single number, which is interpreted as meaning base units, like <b>(M 60)</b>, or a list with an indirection to another unit in a chain, like <b>(H (60 M))</b>.</p><p>This utility function is recursive. In order to find the multiplier against the base unit, we multiply each step in the chain with another call to the utility function to work out the rest of the chain. When the call stack winds back, we get the multiplier used to convert values of a given unit into the base unit. For instance, when we're constructing the multiplier for hours, we find that there are 60 minutes in an hour. We recurse and find there are 60 seconds in a minute. We recurse again and find that seconds is the end of a chain—minutes were specified directly in terms of the base unit. So, winding back from the recursion, we evaluate <b>(* 60 (* 60 1))</b>, which is 3600: there are 3600 seconds in an hour.</p><p></p><fieldset><legend>DEFUNITS-2</legend><pre class="lol_code">(defmacro! defunits%% (quantity base-unit &amp;rest units)

Instead of splicing in the value straight from the unit spec, we pass each unit and the entire unit spec to the <b>defunits-chaining%</b> utility. As described above, this function recursively works out the multiplier required to turn each unit into the base unit. With this multiplier, <b>defunits%%</b> can splice the value into a case statement just like <b>defunits%</b>.</p><p>As yet, these macros are incomplete. The <b>defunits%</b> macro didn't support chaining. <b>Defunits%%</b> supported chaining but lacks <i>error checking</i>. A professional macro writer always takes care to handle any error conditions that might arise. Cases that involve infinite loops, or are otherwise difficult to debug in the REPL, are especially important.</p><p></p><fieldset><legend>DEFUNITS</legend><pre class="lol_code">(defun defunits-chaining (u units prev)

  m (1/60 h)
  h (60 m))</pre><p></p><p>In order to provide proper debugging output, we need to enhance our implementation slightly. Our final version, <b>defunits</b>, allows chaining and also provides useful debugging output should a user of the language specify a program with such a cyclic dependency. It can do this because it uses <b>defunits-chaining</b>, an improved version of <b>defunits-chaining%</b> that maintains a list of all the units that have previously been visited. This way, if we ever visit that unit again through chaining, we can throw an error that concisely describes the problem:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (defunits time s

    h (60 m))

Error in function DEFUNITS-CHAINING:

If a new unit is searched for and we've already visited it, a cycle has been detected. We can use this history of units visited to display a helpful message to users of the macro, very probably ourselves, that accidentally write cycles.</p><p>So <b>defunits</b> is a language specific to the domain of entering units to a conversion routine. Actually it is specific to a much finer domain than that; there are many possible ways it could have been written. Because it is hard to create languages in Blub, and it is easy in lisp, lisp programmers usually don't bother trying to cram everything into one domain. Instead, they just make the language more and more specific to the domain in question until the eventual goal becomes trivial.</p><p></p><fieldset><legend>UNIT-OF-DISTANCE</legend><pre class="lol_code">(defunits distance m

<p>Macros can leverage a technique called <i>implicit context</i>. In code that is used frequently, or absolutely must be concise and lacking any surrounding book-keeping cruft, we sometimes choose to implicitly add lisp code around portions of an expression so we don't have to write it every time we make use of an abstraction. We've talked before about implicit contexts and it should be clear that even when not programming macros they are a fundamental part of lisp programming: let and lambda forms have an <i>implicit progn</i> because they evaluate, in sequence, the forms in their body and return the last result. <b>Defun</b> adds an <i>implicit lambda</i> around forms so you don't need to use a lambda form for named functions.</p><p>This section describes the derivation and construction of a <i>code-walking</i> macro used later in this book, <b>tree-leaves</b><a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap5.html#" onclick="toggle_note(4); return false"><sup>4</sup></a><span id="note_4" style="display:none"> <sup><i>Also see the C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> function <b>subst</b>.</i></sup> </span>. Like <b>flatten</b>, this macro inspects a piece of lisp code, considering it a tree, then performs some modifications and returns a new tree. The list structure of the original expression is not modified: <b>flatten</b> and <b>tree-leaves</b> both cons new structure. The difference between the two is that while the purpose of <b>flatten</b> is to remove nested lists and return a flat list that isn't really lisp code, <b>tree-leaves</b> preserves the shape of the expression but changes the values of particular atoms.</p><p></p><fieldset><legend>TREE-LEAVES-1</legend><pre class="lol_code">(defun tree-leaves% (tree result)
  (if tree
    (if (listp tree) 
      (cons
        (tree-leaves% (car tree)
                      result)
        (tree-leaves% (cdr tree)
                      result))
      result)))</pre></fieldset><p></p><p>Let's start off with a simple sketch. <b>Tree-leaves%</b> is a function that recurses across the provided <b>tree</b> expression, consing a new list structure with the same shape<a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap5.html#" onclick="toggle_note(5); return false"><sup>5</sup></a><span id="note_5" style="display:none"> <sup><i>An empty else clause in an if form returns <b>nil</b>, which is also the empty list.</i></sup> </span>. When it discovers an atom, instead of returning that atom it returns the value of the <b>result</b> argument:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (tree-leaves%
    '(2 (nil t (a . b)))
    'leaf)

(LEAF (NIL LEAF (LEAF . LEAF)))</pre><p></p><p>So <b>tree-leaves%</b> returns a new tree with all atoms converted into our provided symbol, <b>leaf</b>. Notice that the atom <b>nil</b> in a car position of a cons cell is not changed, just as it isn't changed when it resides in the cdr position (and represents an empty list).</p><p>Changing every element is, of course, pretty useless. What we really want is a way to pick and choose specific atoms and selectively apply transformations to them to get new atoms to insert into the new list structure, leaving atoms we aren't interested in untouched. In lisp, the most straightforward way to write a customisable utility function is to allow <i>plug-ins</i> where the user can use custom code to control the utility's behaviour. The <b>sort</b> function included with C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> is an example of this. Here, the less-than function is plugged-in to <b>sort</b>:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (sort '(5 1 2 4 3 8 9 6 7) #'&lt;)

Or, when we need even more power, we can create functions that create these anonymous functions for us. This is known as <i>function composition</i>.

<p><i>Lisp isn't a language, it's a building material.

—Alan Kay</i></p><p>Forms of expression that are written and seldom spoken, like computer code, often breed diverse pronunciation habits. Most programmers run a dialogue in their heads, reasoning expressions and pronouncing operators, sometimes consciously, often not. For example, the most obvious way to pronounce the name of the lisp special form <b>macrolet</b> is simply the audible concatenation of its two lispy component words: macro and let. But after reading Steele's observation<sup><small>[CLTL2-P153]</small></sup> that some lisp programmers pronounce it in a way that rhymes with <i>Chevrolet</i>, it can be difficult to get this humorous pronunciation out of your programming dialogue.</p><p>However it is pronounced, <b>macrolet</b> is a vital part of advanced lisp programming. <b>Macrolet</b> is a C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> special form that introduces new macros into its enclosed lexical scope. Writing <b>macrolet</b> syntax transformations is done in the same way as defining global macros with <b>defmacro</b>. Just as lisp will expand occurrences of <b>defmacro</b>-defined macros in your code, <b>macrolet</b>-defined macros will be expanded by the lisp system when it <i>code-walks</i> your expressions.</p><p>But <b>macrolet</b> is not just a convenience. It offers a number of important advantages over using <b>defmacro</b> to define macros. First, if you want to have uses of a macro expand differently given their lexical contexts in an expression, creating different <b>macrolet</b> contexts is required. <b>Defmacro</b> just won't work.</p><p>Most importantly, <b>macrolet</b> is useful because of how difficult it is to code-walk C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> expressions. Often we have an arbitrary tree of lisp code, say because we are macro-processing it, and we would like to change the values or meaning of different branches of the tree. To do things like implement temporary meanings for certain forms, and to temporarily over-ride specific macros, perhaps only in particular portions of the lexical context of an expression, we need to walk code. Specifically, we need to recurse through the code, looking for our desired macro or function name in a position where it is being evaluated, and substitute our own expression in its place.</p><p>Easy, right? The difficulty is that many legitimate lisp code fragments will break a naive code-walker implementation. Consider if we would like to perform special substitutions for evaluations of a function of a certain symbol, say, <b>blah</b>. If we are given the following expression, it is easy to tell that the substitution should occur:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">(blah t)</pre><p></p><p><b>Blah</b> appears in the function position of a list that will get evaluated when the expression is evaluated so we should obviously make the substitution. So far so good. But what if we are passed this form:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">'(blah t)</pre><p></p><p>Because it is quoted, this bit of code is meant to return a literal list. Performing the substitution here would be incorrect. So our code-walker must know to stop when it hits a quote and make no substitutions in the form being quoted. Fine, that is easy enough. But let's consider if there are any other situations where it would be incorrect to expand <b>blah</b>. What if the code is using <b>blah</b> as the name for a lexical variable?</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">(let ((blah t))
  blah)</pre><p></p><p>Even though <b>blah</b> appears as the first element of a list, here it appears in a local binding for a let form and a use of that binding so should not be expanded. Even this doesn't seem too bad. We could add some special case logic to our code-walker so it knows what to do when it encounters a let form. Unfortunately, we still have 23 more ANSI C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> special forms<a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap5.html#" onclick="toggle_note(8); return false"><sup>8</sup></a><span id="note_8" style="display:none"> <sup><i>There are 25 special forms in ANSI CL, 23 without <b>let</b> and <b>quote</b>.</i></sup> </span> that need to have special case logic added for them. What's more, many special forms are complicated to correctly walk. <b>Let</b>, as we've already seen, can be tricky, and it gets even worse. The following potentially legal C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> form contains one use of <b>blah</b> that should be expanded. Which one?</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">(let (blah (blah (blah blah)))
  blah)</pre><p></p><p>So code-walking is difficult because correctly handling all the special forms is difficult (also see <sup><small>[SPECIAL-FORMS]</small></sup> and <sup><small>[USEFUL-LISP-ALGOS2]</small></sup>). Notice that we don't need any special case logic for forms defined as macros. When a macro is encountered, we can simply expand it until it turns into a function call or a special form. If it is a function, we know it follows lambda's once-only, left-to-right evaluation semantics. It is the special forms that we need to develop special case logic for.</p><p>Sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it? It is. A complete C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> code-walker, especially if designed to be portable, is a large, complicated piece of code. So why doesn't C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> provide us an interface for code-walking C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> code? Well, it turns out, in a way, it does, and, in a way, it's called <b>macrolet</b>. Code-walking is exactly what your C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> system needs to do before it can evaluate or compile an expression. Just like our hypothetical code-walker, C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> needs to understand and handle the special semantics of <b>let</b> and other special forms.</p><p>Since C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> has to walk our code in order to evaluate it, there is usually little need for a separate code-walking program. If we want to make selective transformations to expressions in a way that is smart about what will actually be evaluated, we can simply encode our transformation as a macro and then wrap a <b>macrolet</b> form around the expression. C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> will code-walk this expression when it is evaluated or compiled and will apply the macro transformations specified by the <b>macrolet</b>. Of course since <b>macrolet</b> defines macros, it does not impose any additional overhead at run-time. Macrolet is for communicating with C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small>'s code-walker and the only guarantee that C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> makes as to when a macro will be expanded is that it will be done before the run-time of a compiled function<sup><small>[CLTL2-P685]</small></sup><sup><small>[ON-LISP-P25]</small></sup>.</p><p>One of the most common scenarios for using <b>macrolet</b> is when you want to pretend that a function is bound in a certain lexical context but you would like the behaviour of using this form to be something other than a function call. <b>Flet</b> and <b>labels</b> are out—they can only define functions. So our choices are to write a code-walker to look for invocations of this function and replace them with something else, define a global macro with <b>defmacro</b> so the "function" will expand into something else, or wrap the form in a <b>macrolet</b> and let the system's code-walker sort it out for us.</p><p>As mentioned above, writing a code-walker is hard. If at all possible we should avoid that route. Using a global <b>defmacro</b> is sometimes possible but often problematic. The largest issue is that C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> makes few guarantees about when—or how often—macros will be expanded, so we can't reliably use the same name to have different meanings in different lexical contexts. When we overwrite a global macro we can't know if C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> has expanded—or will want to again expand in the future—old uses of the macro.</p><p>For an example of where this code-walking is useful, let's re-visit an issue that we swept under the rug in <a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap3.html#sec_3">section 3.3, Control Structures</a>. Our initial version of the Scheme named let macro, <b>nlet</b>, used the <b>labels</b> special form to create a new type of control structure. This use of <b>labels</b> allowed us to temporarily define a function for use inside the named let body that would allow us to recurse, as if we started the <b>let</b> over again with new values for the <b>let</b> bindings. When we defined this function, we mentioned that because C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> does not guarantee that it will optimise away tail calls, it is possible that each iteration of this named let control structure will take up needless additional stack space. In other words, unlike in Scheme, C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> function calls are not guaranteed to be <i>tail call optimised</i>.</p><p>Even though most decent C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> compilers will perform proper tail call optimisation, sometimes we need to be certain that the optimisation is being made. The easiest portable way to accomplish this is to change the <b>nlet</b> macro so that the expansions it generates necessarily use no unnecessary stack space.</p><p></p><fieldset><legend>NLET-TAIL</legend><pre class="lol_code">(defmacro! nlet-tail (n letargs &amp;rest body)

We use <b>block</b> and <b>return-from</b> statements to return the value of the final expression because we are trying to mimic the behaviour of a let form and its implicit progn. Notice that we use a gensym for the name of this block and a gensym for each <b>let</b> parameter to avoid unwanted capture and the loop macro<a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap5.html#" onclick="toggle_note(9); return false"><sup>9</sup></a><span id="note_9" style="display:none"> <sup><i><b>Loop</b> is oddly one of the most controversial issues in C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small>.

Here is the same unimaginative example we used when we presented <b>nlet</b>, except that it is guaranteed, even in a lisp that doesn't perform tail call optimisation, to not consume extra stack space:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">(defun nlet-tail-fact (n)
  (nlet-tail fact ((n n) (acc 1))
    (if (zerop n)
      acc
      (fact (- n 1) (* acc n)))))</pre><p></p><p>As this is the motivating example for this section, notice that we use <b>macrolet</b> to code-walk the supplied body looking for uses of <b>fact</b>. Where our original <b>nlet</b> uses the <b>labels</b> special form to bind a function, we would like to guarantee that no additional stack space is consumed when we invoke the named let. Technically, we would like to change some bindings in our lexical environment and perform a jump back to the top of the named let. So <b>nlet-tail</b> takes the provided name of the let, <b>fact</b> in our above usage example, and creates a <i>local macro</i> which only takes effect inside the supplied body. This macro expands into code that uses <b>psetq</b> to set the bindings of the <b>let</b> to the new provided values and then jumps back to the top, no stack space required. And most importantly, we can use the name <b>fact</b> for other unrelated macros in our program<a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap5.html#" onclick="toggle_note(10); return false"><sup>10</sup></a><span id="note_10" style="display:none"> <sup><i>What kind of programming book doesn't have a few factorial implementations anyways?</i></sup> </span>.</p><p>To implement this jumping, <b>nlet-tail</b> uses a combination of the lisp special forms <b>tagbody</b> and <b>go</b>. These two forms offer a <i>goto</i> system. Although the problems gotos impose upon <i>structured programming</i>, whatever that means, are widely discussed, C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> offers these special forms for exactly the reason we use them here. By controlling the <i>program counter</i>—the current location in the code we are executing—we can create very efficient macro expansions. While gotos are usually discouraged in modern <i>high-level</i> languages, a quick look at any bit of assembly code will show that gotos are very much alive and kicking at the lowest level of our computer software. Even the most adamant anti-goto advocates do not suggest ridding <i>low-level</i> languages like C and assembly of goto and jump instructions. It seems that at a low level of programming, we just sort of need gotos, at least to write efficient code.</p><p>However, as Alan Kay says, lisp isn't a language—it is a building material. Talking about whether lisp is high or low level just doesn't make sense. There is very high-level lisp like our domain specific languages. With the macros we write to handle these languages, we convert their uses into a lower level of lisp. These expansions are, of course, lisp code too, just not as compressed as our original version. Next, we typically give this medium-level lisp code to a compiler which successively converts it to lower and lower levels of lisp. It won't be long at all before concepts like gotos, conditional branching, and bit fiddling make it into the code, but even then it will still be lisp. Eventually, with a native code compiler, your high level lisp program will have been converted down to assembly language. But even then, chances are that your program will still be lisp. Since most lisp assemblers are written in lisp itself it is only natural to store these assembly programs as lisp objects, resulting in really low-level programs that really are still lisp. It is only once the program is actually assembled into binary machine code that it ceases to be lisp. Or does it?</p><p>High and low level distinctions are not applicable to lisp; the level of a lisp program is all a matter of perspective. Lisp is not a language, but instead the most flexible software building material yet discovered.</p><h3 id="sec_5">Recursive Expansions</h3>
<p>When teaching lisp by example to beginners, a question that inevitably arises soon into the lesson is</p><p><i>WTF is a cadr?</i></p><p>There are two ways to proceed at this point. The first is to explain to the student that lisp lists are built of cons cells, each of which has a pointer called car and a pointer called cdr. Once this concept is understood, it is easy to show how the accessor functions for these pointers, also named car and cdr, can be combined into a function called <b>cadr</b> that traverses a list and retrieves the second element.</p><p>The second approach is to point the student to the C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> function <b>second</b> and ignore <b>cadr</b> altogether. Both <b>cadr</b> and <b>second</b> accomplish the same task: retrieving the second element of a list. The difference is that <b>second</b> is named for what it does, and <b>cadr</b> is named for how it does it. <b>Cadr</b> is <i>transparently specified</i>. While <b>second</b> is an easy to remember name for the function, it undesirably obscures the meaning of the operation<a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap5.html#" onclick="toggle_note(11); return false"><sup>11</sup></a><span id="note_11" style="display:none"> <sup><i>Particularly because <b>second</b> is exactly the same as <b>cadr</b>: you can't use it to get the second elements of other sequences like vectors.</i></sup> </span>. Transparent specifications are often better because we can think about using the <b>cadr</b> function for more than just taking the second element of a list. For instance, we can transparently use <b>cadr</b> as a concept for getting the argument destructuring list of a lambda form. <b>Cadr</b> and <b>second</b> both perform the same task underneath, but can conceptually represent different operations<sup><small>[CLTL2-P530]</small></sup>.</p><p>Even more important than a philosophical preference for transparent specifications, combinations of <b>car</b> and <b>cdr</b> can represent more list accessor operations, and more consistently, than the handful of english accessor words. <b>Car</b> and <b>cdr</b> are useful because we can combine them into new, arbitrary functions. For instance, <b>(cadadr x)</b> is the same as <b>(car (cdr (car (cdr x))))</b>. C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> mandates that all combinations of <b>car</b> and <b>cdr</b> of length four or less must be defined. So although there is no function <b>second-of-second</b> for taking the second element of a list and then treating it as a list and retrieving its second element, we can use <b>cadadr</b> for this purpose.</p><p>It is especially convenient to have these pre-defined combinations of <b>car</b> and <b>cdr</b> available for functions that take a <b>:key</b> accessor argument, like <b>find</b>:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (find 'a
    '(((a b) (c d)) ((c d) (b a)))
    :key #'cadadr)

((C D) (B A))</pre><p></p><p>Using our pre-defined <b>cadadr</b> accessor is a more concise than constructing the equivalent lambda expression of a composition of english accessor combinations:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (find 'a

So <b>(nth 2 list)</b><a href="https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap5.html#" onclick="toggle_note(12); return false"><sup>12</sup></a><span id="note_12" style="display:none"> <sup><i>We can comfortably use <b>list</b> as a variable name because of C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small>'s second namespace.

Having to combine inconsistent abstractions to accomplish a task is often an indication of incompleteness. Can we define a domain specific language for the domain of accessing lists in order to unite these <b>car</b> and <b>cdr</b> combining functions, the english accessors, and functions like <b>nth</b> and <b>nthcdr</b>?</p><p>Since <b>car</b> and <b>cdr</b> are the fundamental operators, our language should involve combining these two accessors in a fully general way. Because there are an infinite number of such combinations, continuing the combinations by defining functions for every possible accessor is plainly infeasible. What we really want is a single macro that can expand into efficient list traversal code.</p><p>The syntax of specifying a list accessor function by naming it starting with a C, followed by one or more A or D characters and ending with an R, is very intuitive and is roughly what we would like to copy for our language.

<p>In our discussion of closures we alluded to how a closure can be used as an object, and how, generally, indefinite extent and lexical scope can replace complicated object systems. But one feature that objects frequently provide that we have mostly ignored up until now is multiple <i>methods</i>. In other words, while our simple counter closure example only allows one operation, increment, objects usually want to be able to respond to different <i>messages</i> with different behaviours.</p><p>Although a closure can be thought of as an object with exactly one method—<b>apply</b>—that one method can be designed so as to have different behaviours based on the arguments passed to it. For instance, if we designate the first argument to be a symbol representing the message being passed, we can provide multiple behaviours with a simple <b>case</b> statement based on the first argument.</p><p>To implement a counter with an increment method and a decrement method, we might use this:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">(let ((count 0))

Keywords are convenient because we don't have to quote them or export them from packages, and are also intuitive because they are designed to perform this and other sorts of <i>destructuring</i>. Often in a lambda or defmacro form keywords are not destructured at run-time. But since we are implementing a message passing system, which is a type of <i>run-time destructuring</i>, we leave the keyword processing operation to be performed at run-time. As previously discussed, destructuring on symbols is an efficient operation: a mere pointer comparison.

Although left empty in the above let over dlambda, the lists following the keyword symbols are actually <i>lambda destructuring</i> lists. Each dispatch case, in other words each keyword argument, can have its own distinct lambda destructuring list, as in the following enhancement to the counter closure:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (setf (symbol-function 'count-test)
    (let ((count 0))
      (dlambda
        (:reset () (setf count 0))
        (:inc (n) (incf count n))
        (:dec (n) (decf count n))
        (:bound (lo hi)
          (setf count
            (min hi
                 (max lo
                      count)))))))

#&lt;Interpreted Function&gt;</pre><p></p><p>We now have several different possible lambda destructuring lists that might be used, depending on our first keyword argument. <b>:reset</b> requires no arguments and brings <b>count</b> back to 0:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (count-test :reset)

0</pre><p></p><p><b>:inc</b> and <b>:dec</b> both take a numeric argument, <b>n</b>:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (count-test :inc 100)

100</pre><p></p><p>And <b>:bound</b> ensures that the value of <b>count</b> is between two <i>boundary values</i>, <b>lo</b> and <b>hi</b>. If <b>count</b> falls outside this boundary it is changed to the closest boundary value:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (count-test :bound -10 10)

10</pre><p></p><p>An important property of <b>dlambda</b> is that it uses lambda for all destructuring so as to preserve the normal error checking and debugging support provided by our C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>ISP</small> environment. For instance, if we give only one argument to <b>count-test</b> we will get an error directly comparable to an incorrect <i>arity</i> lambda application:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (count-test :bound -10)

ERROR: Wrong argument count, wanted 2 and got 1.</pre><p></p><p>Especially when <b>dlambda</b> is embedded into a lexical environment forming a closure, <b>dlambda</b> allows us to program—in object oriented jargon—as though we are creating an object with multiple <i>methods</i>. <b>Dlambda</b> is tailored so as to make this functionality easily accessible while not departing from the syntax and usage of lambda. <b>Dlambda</b> still expands into a single lambda form and, as such, its evaluation results in exactly what evaluating <b>lambda</b> results in: an <i>anonymous function</i> that can be saved, applied, and, most importantly, used as the lambda component of a lexical closure.</p><p>But <b>dlambda</b> takes this synchronisation with lambda one step further. In order for <b>dlambda</b> to provide as smooth a transition from code containing the <b>lambda</b> macro as possible, <b>dlambda</b> also allows us to process invocations of the anonymous function that don't pass a keyword argument as the first symbol. When we have large amounts of code written using the closure through a normal lambda interface we would appreciate being able to add special case dlambda methods without changing how the rest of the code uses the interface.</p><p>If the last possible method is given the symbol <b>t</b> instead of a keyword argument, the provided method will always be invoked if none of the special case keyword argument methods are found to apply. Here is a contrived example:</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (setf (symbol-function 'dlambda-test)
    (dlambda
      (:something-special ()
        (format t "SPECIAL~%"))
      (t (&amp;rest args)
        (format t "DEFAULT: ~a~%" args))))

#&lt;Interpreted Function&gt;</pre><p></p><p>With this definition, the majority of ways to call this function invoke the default case. Our default case uses the <b>&amp;rest</b> lambda destructuring argument to accept all possible arguments; we are free to narrow the accepted arguments by providing more specific lambda destructuring parameters.</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (dlambda-test 1 2 3)
DEFAULT: (1 2 3)
NIL
* (dlambda-test)
DEFAULT: NIL
NIL</pre><p></p><p>However, even though this anonymous function acts mostly like a regular lambda form defined with the default case, we can pass a keyword argument to invoke the special method.</p><p></p><pre class="lol_pre">* (dlambda-test :something-special)
SPECIAL
NIL</pre><p></p><p>A key feature, one that will be exploited heavily by the following chapter, is that both the default method and all the special methods are, of course, invoked in the lexical context of the encompassing <b>dlambda</b>. Because of how closely <b>dlambda</b> is integrated with lambda notation, this lets us bring multi-method techniques to the domain of creating and extending lexical closures.</p><center><p>All material is (C) Doug Hoyte unless otherwise noted or implied.
