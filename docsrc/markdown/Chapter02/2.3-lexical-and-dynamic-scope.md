The technical term for where to consider a variable reference valid is _scope_. The most common type of scope in modern languages is called _lexical_ scope. When a fragment of code is surrounded by the lexical binding of a variable, that variable is said to be in the lexical scope of the binding. The **let** form, which is one of the most common ways to create bindings, can introduce these lexically scoped variables:
```
* (let ((x 2))
    x)

2
```
The **x** inside the body of the **let** form was accessed through lexical scope. Similarly, arguments to functions defined by **lambda** or **defun** are also lexically bound variables inside the text of the function definition. Lexical variables are variables that can only be accessed by code appearing inside the context of, for instance, the above **let** form. Because lexical scoping is such an intuitive way to limit the scope of access to a variable, it can appear to be the only way. Are there any other possibilities for scoping?


As useful as the combination of indefinite extent and lexical scoping turns out to be, it has until recently not been used to its fullest extent in mainstream programming languages. The first implementation was by Steve Russell for Lisp 1.5[HISTORY-OF-LISP] and was subsequently designed directly into languages like Algol-60, Scheme, and COMMON LISP. Despite this long and fruitful history, the numerous advantages of lexical scoping are only slowly being taken up by many Blubs.


Although the scoping methods provided by C-like languages are limited, C programmers need to program across different environments too. To do so, they often use an imprecisely defined scoping known as _pointer scope_. Pointer scope is famous for its difficulty to debug, numerous security risks, and, somewhat artificially, its efficiency. The idea behind pointer scoping is to define a domain specific language for controlling the registers and memory of a Von Neumman machine similar to most modern CPUs[PAIP-PIX], then to use this language to access and manipulate data-structures with fairly direct commands to the CPU running the program. Pointer scoping was necessary for performance reasons before decent lisp compilers were invented but is now regarded as a problem with, rather than a feature of, modern programming languages.


Even though lisp programmers seldom think in terms of pointers, the understanding of pointer scoping is very valuable in the construction of efficient lisp code. In [section 7.4, Pointer Scope](https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap7.html#sec_4) we will investigate implementing pointer scoping for the rare cases where we need to instruct the compiler on specific code creation. But for now we only need discuss its mechanics. In C, we sometimes would like to access a variable defined outside the function we are writing:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void pointer_scope_test() {
  int a;
  scanf("%d", &a);
}
```


In the above function we use the C **&** operator to give the actual address in memory of our local variable **a** to the **scanf** function so it knows where to write the data it scans. Lexical scoping in lisp forbids us from implementing this directly. In lisp, we would likely pass an anonymous function to a hypothetical lisp **scanf** function, allowing it to set our lexical variable **a** even though **scanf** is defined outside our lexical scope:
```
(let (a)
  (scanf "%d" (lambda (v) (setf a v))))
```
Lexical scope is the enabling feature for closures. In fact, closures are so related to this concept of lexical scope that they are often referred to more specifically as _lexical closures_ to distinguish them from other types of closures. Unless otherwise noted, all closures in this book are lexical.
In addition to lexical scope, COMMON LISP provides _dynamic scope_. This is lisp _slang_ for the combination of temporary extent and global scope. Dynamic scoping is a type of scoping that is unique to lisp in that it offers a very different behaviour but shares an identical syntax with lexical scope. In COMMON LISP we deliberately choose to call attention to variables accessed with dynamic scope by calling them _special variables_. These special variables can be defined with **defvar**. Some programmers follow a convention of prefixing and postfixing special variable names with asterisks, like ***temp-special***. This is called the _earmuff_ convention. For reasons explained in [section 3.7, Duality of Syntax](https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap3.html#sec_7), this book does not use earmuffs so our special variable declarations look like this:
```
(defvar temp-special)
```
When defined like this, **temp-special** will be designated special[2](https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap2.html#) but will not be initialised with a value. In this state, a special variable is said to be _unbound_. Only special variables can be unbound—lexical variables are always bound and thus always have values. Another way of thinking of this is that by default all symbols represent lexically unbound variables. Just as with lexical variables, we can assign a value to special variables with **setq** or **setf**. Some lisps, like Scheme, do not have dynamic scope. Others, like EuLisp[SMALL-PIECES-P46], use different syntax for accessing lexical versus special variables. But in COMMON LISP the syntax is shared. Many lispers consider this a feature. Here we assign a value to our special variable **temp-special**:
```
(setq temp-special 1)
```
So far, this special variable doesn't seem that special. It seems to be just another variable, bound in some sort of global namespace. This is because we have only bound it once—its default special global binding. Special variables are most interesting when they are re-bound, or _shadowed_, by new environments. If we define a function that simply evaluates and returns **temp-special**:
```
(defun temp-special-returner ()
  temp-special)
```
This function can be used to examine the value that lisp evaluates **temp-special** to be at the moment in time when it was called:
```
* (temp-special-returner)
1
```
This is sometimes referred to as evaluating the form in a _null lexical environment_. The null lexical environment obviously doesn't contain any lexical bindings. Here the value of **temp-special** returned is that of its global special value, 1. But if we evaluate it in a non-null lexical environment—one that contains a binding for our special variable—the specialness of **temp-special** reveals itself[3](https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap2.html#):
```
* (let ((temp-special 2))
    (temp-special-returner))

2
```
Notice that the value 2 was returned, meaning that the **temp-special** value was taken from our **let** environment, not its global special value. If this still does not seem interesting, see how this cannot be done in most other conventional programming languages as exemplified by this piece of Blub pseudo-code:
```c
int global_var = 0;

function whatever() {
  int global_var = 1;
  do_stuff_that_uses_global_var();
}

function do_stuff_that_uses_global_var() {
  // global_var is 0
}
```
While the memory locations or register assignments for lexical bindings are known at compile-time[4](https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap2.html#), special variable bindings are determined at run-time—in a sense. Thanks to a clever trick, special variables aren't as inefficient as they seem. A special variable actually always does refer to the same location in memory. When you use **let** to bind a special variable, you are actually compiling in code that will store a copy of the variable, over-write the memory location with a new value, evaluate the forms in the let body, and, finally, restore the original value from the copy.


Special variables are perpetually associated with the symbol used to name them. The location in memory referred to by a special variable is called the **symbol-value** cell of a symbol. This is in direct contrast to lexical variables. Lexical variables are only indicated with symbols at compile-time. Because lexical variables can only be accessed from inside the lexical scope of their bindings, the compiler has no reason to even remember the symbols that were used to reference lexical variables so it will remove them from compiled code. We will stretch the truth of this statement in [section 6.7, Pandoric Macros](../Chapter06/6.7-pandoric-macros.md).


Although COMMON LISP does offer the invaluable feature of dynamic scope, lexical variables are the most common. Dynamic scoping used to be a defining feature of lisp but has, since COMMON LISP, been almost completely replaced by lexical scope. Since lexical scoping enables things like lexical closures (which we examine shortly), as well as more effective compiler optimisations, the superseding of dynamic scope is mostly seen as a good thing. However, the designers of COMMON LISP have left us a very transparent window into the world of dynamic scoping, now acknowledged for what it really is: special.
