#+TITLE: Let Over Lambda Translation Project

This is a project of translation *[[lol][lol(let over lambda)]]*.
Cause the original copy is a pdf, I download html format from the official
website, and using /pandoc/ and convert them into markdown, pdf and org format.
So, if you find any extra or wrong formats, please help me to correct it.
Also, I'm glad that someone could help me on improving this translations.

Any questions, please /[[mailto:yu.qi-liu@outlook.com][contact me]]/
